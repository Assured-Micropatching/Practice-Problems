# Assured Micropatching Practice Challenges
Practice challenges are inspired by the DARPA AMP transition partners and represent challenges they have faced. These challenges are not officially evaluated using performance metrics by the TA3 teams, but solutions to these challenges reflect well on the AMP program.

Each directory in this repository is a standalone practice problem. Some problems have support for multiple architectures and different ways to patch the binary to satisfy the needs of the engineering team requesting the patch.

Most of the time, source code and source code patches will be available.
