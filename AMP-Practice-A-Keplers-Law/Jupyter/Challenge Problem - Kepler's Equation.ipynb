    "# DARPA AMP Numerical Methods Challenge\n",
    "This challenge scenario is to patch a theoretically correct routine that suffers from convergence issues based on the input. The algorithm is the Newton-Raphson method and the problem it's solving is orbit trajectory calculations based on Kepler's laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This challenge is inspired from site visits with NASA Goddard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "A satellite or space probe may have a highly elliptial orbit. These orbits are calculated using Newton's and Kepler's laws. The use of Kepler's equation is shown in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation and many other references regarding orbital mechanics. It is used onboard a space craft to determine its location in orbit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kepler's equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ M = E - e \\sin E $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M$ is the mean anomaly, $E$ is the eccentric anomaly, and $e$ is the eccentricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kepler's equation is a transcendental equation, which means there is not an algebraic solution for E. Instead, we must use a numerical method, like the Newton-Raphson method. To do this, we are looking for a root, so let's transform the equation to \n",
    "$$ f(E) = E - e \\sin(E) - M$$ and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f^\\prime(E) = 1 - e \\cos(E) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with an initial guess $E_0$, then use the Newton-Raphson method to determine a solution. When $f = 0$, the solution is satisfied. The numerical method should converge so $f<tol$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_n = E_{n-1} - \\frac{f(E_{n-1})}{f^\\prime(E_{n-1})}$$\n",
    "Typically this convergence is fast and only takes 3-6 iterations. However, if the tolerance is too tight, and we are using discrete representation of real numbers (i.e. floating point math), then sometimes the convergence criterion can be missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Let's look an an example of solving Kepler's equation using Python. We'll run 2 examples: one that converges quickly, and one that doesn't satisfy the (overly precise) convergence criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convergence criteria for this is the machine's floating point epsilon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The the difference in the input is 0.000001\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is \n",
    "\n",
    " * mean_anomaly = 6.2\n",
    " * eccentricity = .335999 or .3360\n",
    " \n",
    "We'll use the mean_anomaly as our initial guess for E.\n"
